# CNCSpring - Core and Concepts of Spring Framework

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive collection of examples and demonstrations for learning Spring Framework and Java concepts. It serves as an educational resource for developers who want to understand the core concepts of Spring and modern Java programming.

## Main Concepts Covered

### Spring Framework Concepts
- **Inversion of Control (IoC)** - Different types of dependency injection, bean scopes, lazy initialization, and resolving circular dependencies
- **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)** - Cross-cutting concerns, advice types, and pointcut expressions
- **Transaction Management** - Declarative and programmatic transaction management, transaction propagation
- **Spring Data Access** - JDBC, JdbcTemplate, and database operations
- **Exception Handling** - Global exception handling, controller-specific exception handling
- **Interceptors and Filters** - Request processing, custom annotations, and request/response manipulation
- **Bean Scopes** - Singleton, prototype, request, session, and custom scopes
- **Conditional Bean Creation** - Using @ConditionalOnProperty and other conditional annotations
- **Asynchronous Processing** - @Async annotation, thread pools, and handling return values with Future
- **Response Entity** - Building HTTP responses with different status codes and headers

### Java Concepts
- **Modern Java Features** - Records, enhanced switch statements, and lambda expressions
- **Functional Programming** - Method references, functional interfaces, and streams
- **Concurrency** - Threads, ExecutorService, and thread pools
- **Collections** - Lists, arrays, and other collection types

## Project Structure
The project is organized into packages, each focusing on a specific concept:

- `aop` - Aspect-Oriented Programming examples
- `async` - Asynchronous processing with Spring
- `beanscope` - Spring bean scope demonstrations
- `conditional_on_property` - Conditional bean creation
- `dynamic_bean_initialization` - Dynamic bean initialization techniques
- `exceptionHandling` - Exception handling strategies
- `interceptorsAndFilters` - Spring interceptors and filters
- `ioc` - Inversion of Control and dependency injection
- `layeredArchitecture` - Layered architecture pattern implementation
- `responseEntity` - Working with ResponseEntity in Spring
- `springJpa` - Spring Data access with JDBC and JdbcTemplate
- `threadPool` - Thread pool configurations and usage
- `transactions` - Transaction management in Spring

Each package contains its own README with detailed explanations of the concepts and code examples.
