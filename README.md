# 🌱 BasicSpringConcepts - Core and Concepts of Spring Framework

Welcome to this open-source repository documenting my journey in learning **Spring Framework** and modern **Java concepts**.

This project is based on the excellent tutorials and explanations by **[Concept & Coding YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ConceptAndCoding)**.  
All implementations are written from scratch as I follow along with videos — to understand not just *what*, but *why* behind each concept.

> 📌 **Note**: This is a learning-focused project. I'm not the original author of these concepts or code structures — all credit goes to the amazing content creator at Concept & Coding.

## 📦 Repository Structure

Each concept is organized into its own package under `src/main/java`, with:
- ✅ Java/Spring code demonstrating the concept.
- 📝 A `README.md` explaining:
    - The core idea of the concept.
    - Key Spring/Java features used.
    - Real-world relevance.
    - Code flow & behavior.
